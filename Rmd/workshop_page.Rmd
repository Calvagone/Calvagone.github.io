# 5th European Course on Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Protein Therapeutics in Barcelona

From September 24th to 27th, we will be hosting the 5th European Course on Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Protein Therapeutics in Barcelona. 
The course directors are Prof. Bernd Meibohm and Prof. Johan Gabrielsson.

This 4-day course will introduce participants to basic principles in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of novel therapeutic proteins and provide opportunities for basic hands-on exercises in the PK/PD evaluation of these compounds. Topics include target-mediated drug disposition, tissue and tumor penetration, first-in-human dose selection, immunogenicity, clinical pharmacology challenges, biosimilars, ADCs, bispecific antibodies and drug-drug interactions.

On the 4th day, Calvagone will give a hands-on introduction to e-Campsis, the free online PK/PD simulator, with examples focused on protein PK.

Registration fees:

```         
Regular: €2200 
Academia/Trainee: €800 (excl. VAT)
Early-bird registration (before June 30th 2024): 10% discount

# e-Campsis Workshop at PAGE 2024 in Rome

On Tuesday the 25th of June 2024, we will be hosting a 1-day workshop on e-Campsis at the [PAGE meeting](https://www.page-meeting.org/) in Rome.

As a participant you will get free access to e-Campsis pro. You will learn how to:

-   Import a model from various sources (Campsis, model library, NONMEM)
-   Set up a trial design
-   Bootstrap covariates from an external source (e.g. NHANES)
-   Simulate specific individuals, a population or a clinical trial with uncertainty
-   Explore what-if scenarios thanks to the built-in scenario creator
-   Stratify and visualize the results with customizable plots
-   Post-process the results, derive useful metrics and summary statistics and generate HTML tables in a few clicks
-   Create forest plots in an intuitive manner to assess the impact of covariates
-   Make a sensitivity analysis effortlessly and understand the limitations of your model

You will also learn how to reproduce the simulations offline in R thanks to the open-source package campsis.

The following registration fee applies for this 1-day workshop:

```         
Industry:   € 300 excl. VAT 
Academic:   € 150 excl. VAT 
Student:    € 100 excl. VAT 
```

The fee includes the workshop material, lunch and coffee breaks as well as temporary access to e-Campsis pro for 2 months (4 months if you register before March 31st 2024).
On top of it you will get a 50% discount on the annual subscription fee.

This course only requires limited knowledge of R, since all hands-on exercises will be done in the web application. You should bring your own laptop.
