On Tuesday the 25th of June 2024, we will be hosting a 1-day workshop on e-Campsis at the [PAGE meeting](https://www.page-meeting.org/) in Rome. 

As a participant you will get free access to e-Campsis pro. You will learn how to:

-	Import a model from various sources (Campsis, model library, NONMEM) 
-	Set up a trial design
-	Bootstrap covariates from an external source (e.g. NHANES)
-	Simulate specific individuals, a population or a clinical trial with uncertainty
-	Explore what-if scenarios thanks to the built-in scenario creator
-	Stratify and visualize the results with customizable plots 
-	Post-process the results, derive useful metrics and summary statistics and generate HTML tables in a few clicks
-	Create forest plots in an intuitive manner to assess the impact of covariates 
-	Make a sensitivity analysis effortlessly and understand the limitations of your model

You will also learn how to reproduce the simulations offline in R thanks to the open-source package campsis.

	Industry:   € 250 excl. VAT
