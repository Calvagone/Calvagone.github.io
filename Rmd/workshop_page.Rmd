# 5th European Course on Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Protein Therapeutics in Barcelona

From September 24th to 27th, we will be hosting the 5th European Course on Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Protein Therapeutics in Barcelona. 
The course directors are Prof. Bernd Meibohm and Prof. Johan Gabrielsson.

This 4-day course will introduce participants to basic principles in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of novel therapeutic proteins and provide opportunities for basic hands-on exercises in the PK/PD evaluation of these compounds. Topics include target-mediated drug disposition, tissue and tumor penetration, first-in-human dose selection, immunogenicity, clinical pharmacology challenges, biosimilars, ADCs, bispecific antibodies and drug-drug interactions.

On the 4th day, Calvagone will give a hands-on introduction to e-Campsis, the free online PK/PD simulator, with examples focused on protein PK.
