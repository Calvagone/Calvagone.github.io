## Preliminaries

* Download and install latest version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
* Download and install [R tools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)

## Install simulation engines

Campsis needs one of these simulation engines to perform simulations: `rxode2` (formerly `RxODE`) or `mrgsolve`.
Install your preferred package(s) as follows:
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rxode2")
install.packages("mrgsolve")
install.packages("RxODE") # Not on CRAN anymore but still supported by Campsis
```

## Install Campsis

Install the latest release of `campsis` from CRAN.
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("campsis") # This will install 'campsismod' as well
```

Alternatively, `campsis` may also be installed from GitHub via devtools.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Calvagone/campsismod")
devtools::install_github("Calvagone/campsis")
```
